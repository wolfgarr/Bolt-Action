# Bolt Action

## Game pieces:
- 2-4 players
- 16x16 grid game board
- 6 bolts (pawns) for each player (M6x32 is a good size), spray painted to different colors for each player
- 6 washers (ranks) for each player, color irrelevant, need to fit the pawns
- Dice: D8 "battle die" and D20 "moving die"

## RULES:

In the beginning of the game, the players arrange their pawns in opposing corners of the board.

### Moving phase:
Each round begins with the moving phase: the player rolls a D20 "moving die". The player may choose to move their game pieces at most the die count.

### Battle phase:
If any of the player's pawns are adjacent to enemy pawns after the moving phase, the player may choose to attack with one pawn against one opposing pawn. The attacker rolls the battle die, and if the attacker rolls a natural 8, the enemy pawn dies instantly and is removed from the game.

If the opposing pawn survives, the opposing player rolls a counter-attack with the battle die. Whichever player has rolled the smaller number loses their pawn. In case of a tie, the attacker wins.

### RANK:
When a pawn wins a battle, it gains a rank. A washer is placed on the pawn to indicate its rank. The number of ranks the pawn has will be added to each roll of the battle die. A pawn may have multiple ranks. (note: the instant win of the attacker only happens when the player rolls a natural 8, no matter the rank)
